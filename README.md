# mlBloodLabs: Blood Monitoring and Predictive Supplement Recommendation System

This project is aimed at developing a **real-time blood monitoring system** that utilizes **optical sensors** and **microneedle patches** to track blood biomarkers. The system applies **machine learning** to analyze blood labs and provide **predictive supplement recommendations** based on the user’s biomarker levels, medical history, and personal health data.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Blood Monitoring**: Leverages optical sensors (NIR spectroscopy, PPG) and microneedle patches for continuous tracking of blood biomarkers (e.g., glucose, lactate, toxins).
- **Predictive Supplement Recommendations**: Provides supplement suggestions to optimize biomarker levels based on machine learning predictions.
- **Personalization**: A one-week personalized training period allows the model to fine-tune predictions based on the user’s medical history and real-time sensor data.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - General model built from aggregated population data.
  - Personalized model fine-tuned using transfer learning based on individual health conditions and biomarkers.

## Project Roadmap

- **TODO**
- **Phase 1: Research and Planning**
  - Complete literature review on optical sensors and microneedle patches.
  - Define the biomarkers and supplements to be tracked and recommended.
- **Phase 2: Data Collection and Processing**
  - Gather real or simulated data from optical sensors and microneedle patches.
  - Preprocess data for machine learning.
- **Phase 3: Model Development**
  - Develop general and personalized machine learning models for predicting blood biomarker changes and supplement needs.
- **Phase 4: Real-Time System Implementation**
  - Integrate real-time sensor data with the machine learning models for continuous tracking and supplement recommendations.
- **Phase 5: Testing and Refinement**
  - Test models for accuracy, latency, and scalability, and refine based on feedback.
